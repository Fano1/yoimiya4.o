<Description>
    Build a complete frontend web application for an interactive anime AI companion using **SolidJS**. 
    The application should have three main sections:
    1. 3D model viewer (currently a solid yellow placeholder)
    2. Input section (text with optional voice-to-text)
    3. Interactive tab-based chat history system with multiple AI-powered environments
    
    The goal is to create a fully functional, anime-inspired, playful, and modular frontend that can later integrate with a backend AI.  
    No Tailwind, use plain CSS with grid layouts.
